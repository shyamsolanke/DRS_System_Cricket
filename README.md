# DRS_System_Cricket
This is python code for simple DRS system

opencv component is added in rough(3).py file

In the demo video we can see 2 screens 
The idea here is when the ball hits the stumps the stump light glows, 
we can use this condition as explained below
the screen on the left will show illuminated part of stumps when there is difference in light intensity in stumps images compared to previous frames
Hence the umpire can focus on that image when stumps part glow in left screen considering it the frame in which ball hits the stumps, then observing the batsman position in original screen to make his/her decision
